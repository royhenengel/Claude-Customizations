# My Workflow Visual Design Implementation Summary

**Completed**: 2026-02-03
**Plan**: planning/specs/my-workflow-visual-design/PLAN.md

## What Was Built

Visual notification system for workflow commands that provides polished, professional feedback during workflow operations. All user-facing messages now use a consistent format with thick lines (━), icons, and clear text.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Task 1: Design visual format - thick lines (━) top and bottom, icon + text, 50 char minimum
- [x] Task 2: Define start.md messages 1-4 - scanning, resume, new project, brownfield
- [x] Task 3: Define start.md messages 5-7 - structure created, overview guidance, project initialized
- [x] Task 4: Update start.md with new visual format - 7 notification types implemented
- [x] Task 5: Update build.md with new visual format - 6 notification types implemented
- [x] Task 6: Update plan.md with new visual format - 4 notification types implemented
- [x] Task 7: Test /start on new project - SKIPPED (fix as we go)

## Deviations

| Rule | What Happened | Resolution |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Task skipped | Task 7 (testing) skipped per user decision | "Fix as we go" approach - issues will be addressed as they're discovered in real usage |

## Verification

- [x] Visual format consistent across all workflows - PASSED
- [x] All notification types documented in PLAN.md Message Catalog - PASSED
- [x] Tone matches requirements (polished, professional, warm but practical) - PASSED

## Files Changed

- `skills/my-workflow/workflows/start.md` - Added visual notifications for 7 workflow states
- `skills/my-workflow/workflows/build.md` - Added visual notifications for 6 workflow states
- `skills/my-workflow/workflows/plan.md` - Added visual notifications for 4 workflow states

## Next Steps

- None - fix issues as they're discovered during real usage
