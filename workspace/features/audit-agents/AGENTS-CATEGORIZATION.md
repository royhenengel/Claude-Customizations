## Categorization Decisions

### Language (L) Agents
Programming language and framework specialists. Includes both pure language experts (python-pro, golang-pro) and framework specialists (react-specialist, laravel-specialist) since frameworks are tightly coupled to their languages.

### Role (R) Agents
Job function specialists that work across technologies. These represent general professional roles (backend-developer, data-scientist) rather than specific technology expertise.

### Domain (D) Agents
Industry-specific specialists (fintech-engineer, game-developer) with deep domain knowledge beyond general software development.

### Infrastructure (I) Agents
DevOps, cloud, and platform specialists. Includes cloud platforms (azure-infra-engineer), container orchestration (kubernetes-specialist), and operational roles (sre-engineer).

### Review (V) Agents
Quality assurance and auditing specialists. Includes code reviewers, security auditors, and specialized auditors for Claude Code components (skill-auditor, slash-command-auditor).

### Management (M) Agents
Coordination and orchestration agents. Includes project management roles and multi-agent coordination (agent-organizer, workflow-orchestrator).

### Utility (U) Agents
General-purpose tools that support multiple workflows. Includes debugging assistants, performance tools, and specialized utilities (git-workflow-manager, refactoring-specialist).

### Workflow Stage Decisions
- Most implementation agents are marked "Execution (E)" as they primarily write/modify code
- Planning agents focus on architecture and design decisions before implementation
- Analysis agents gather and process information without modifying systems
- Review agents evaluate existing work for quality/compliance
- Documentation agents focus on creating written documentation

### Source Classification
- **Standard**: Agents that ship as built-in subagent types in Claude Code's Task tool. Custom .md files may override the built-in behavior.
- **CEK**: Agents from the Context Engineering Kit (NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit). Distinguished by `cek-` prefix. These emphasize AC-driven workflows, binary checklists, and structured outputs.
