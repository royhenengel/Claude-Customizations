# Instruction Compliance Fix - Implementation Summary

**Completed**: 2026-02-15
**Plan**: planning/specs/instruction-compliance/PLAN.md

## What Was Built

Three-layer fix for systemic instruction non-compliance (6 documented incidents where Claude loaded rules but didn't follow them).

**Layer 1 - Reduce noise**: Pruned rules files from 628 to 457 lines. Removed duplicates, meta-rules, and default behavior restatements. Added 5 new rules from user review (accountability, no-filler, documentation source of truth, no hardcoded paths, governance drift).

**Layer 2 - Structural enforcement**: Split 1,008-line build.md monolith into 3 phase files (setup: 173, execute: 271, complete: 276 lines). SKILL.md routes to correct phase via Read tool instead of eager @ expansion. Only ~250 lines load per /build invocation.

**Layer 3 - Instruction design**: Added CRITICAL markers to 5 key rules. Added rationalizations tables for subagent delegation and build completion. Applied prescriptive language ("MUST", "Do NOT") at decision points.

**Layer 4 - Enforcement hook**: Build completion guard fires on UserPromptSubmit when all tasks are checked but stage is still "building", reminding about steps 8-13.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Task 1: Audit and prune rules files
- [x] Task 2: Review pruned rules (checkpoint) - extensive user review, multiple additions
- [x] Task 3: Split build.md into phase files
- [x] Task 4: Update build SKILL.md with phase routing
- [x] Task 5: Apply instruction design improvements
- [x] Task 6: Create build completion guard hook
- [x] Task 7: End-to-end verification (structural checks passed, functional testing deferred to live use)

## Deviations

| Rule | What Happened | Resolution |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Task 2 scope expansion | User review added 5 new rules not in original plan | Added during review, increased total from target 440 to 457 lines |
| Quality Standards / Design Philosophy | Plan said "remove duplicates of CLAUDE.md". User identified these as creation instructions, not rules. | Confirmed already present in skill-creation and subagent-design skills. No action needed. |
| Functional testing skipped | User chose to test during live use instead of dedicated verification | Structural checks all pass. Live testing will follow. |

## Verification

- [x] Rules total: 457 lines (target ≤440, 17 over from user-approved additions)
- [x] Phase files: 173, 271, 276 (all ≤400)
- [x] SKILL.md: no @ references, routes via Read tool
- [x] Hook: executable, silent in non-build contexts
- [x] Rationalizations tables: 2 (execute + complete)
- [x] CRITICAL markers: 5 (execute:2, complete:1, behavioral:1, formatting:1)

## Files Changed

- `rules/ai-chat-prefs.md` - Pruned 154->76, added accountability + no-filler + governance drift
- `rules/technical-consistency.md` - Pruned 130->64, added "prefer editing existing"
- `rules/coding-standards.md` - Pruned 61->51, added "no hardcoded paths"
- `rules/behavioral-rules.md` - Added "documentation is source of truth" + CRITICAL marker
- `rules/formatting-rules.md` - Added CRITICAL marker
- `rules/memory-boundaries.md` - Compressed 99->76
- `skills/Planning/my-workflow/workflows/build-setup.md` - New (Steps 1-4)
- `skills/Planning/my-workflow/workflows/build-execute.md` - New (Steps 5-7)
- `skills/Planning/my-workflow/workflows/build-complete.md` - New (Steps 8-13)
- `skills/Planning/my-workflow/workflows/archive/build-monolith.md` - Archived original
- `skills/Planning/build/SKILL.md` - Phase routing replaces @ expansion
- `scripts/hooks/build-completion-guard.sh` - New hook
- `hooks.json` - Added hook config

## Lessons Learned

- Rules pruning alone is insufficient; structural enforcement (phase splitting, hooks) is needed to prevent skipping steps
- Context compaction is a blind spot: after compaction, workflow context is lost and must be explicitly re-read
- PR review agents catch real bugs (PROGRESS.md vs STATE.md inconsistency, false positive guard, removed timestamp rule) that the implementer missed

## Next Steps

- Test /start, /plan, /build in live use to validate functional behavior
- Monitor compliance improvements across next 5-10 sessions
- Add "model preference" for agents to backlog
