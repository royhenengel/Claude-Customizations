# Claude Code Preferences & Decisions

This document tracks preferences, rules, and decisions for Claude Code customization.

## Skills, Agents & MCP Servers

### When to Use Which

| Use Case | Best Tool | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Reusable prompts/templates | **Skill** | Simple, shares conversation context |
| Domain knowledge/standards | **Skill** | Instructions loaded when relevant |
| Quick behavior enhancements | **Skill** | No subprocess overhead |
| Multi-step autonomous tasks | **Agent** | Runs independently, returns results |
| Parallel execution | **Agent** | Multiple agents can run simultaneously |
| Complex exploration/research | **Agent** | Isolated context, thorough investigation |
| External API integration | **MCP Server** | Direct tool access to external services |
| Real-time data from services | **MCP Server** | Live connection to databases, APIs, apps |
| Actions in external systems | **MCP Server** | Create, update, delete in connected services |

### Tool Selection Guide

```
Need to extend Claude's knowledge/behavior?
├── Static instructions or templates? → Skill
├── Autonomous multi-step work? → Agent
└── Connect to external service/API? → MCP Server

Need to interact with external system?
├── Read/write data? → MCP Server
├── One-time API call? → Skill (with fetch) or MCP Server
└── Complex workflow automation? → MCP Server + Agent
```

### Overlap Analysis (Last checked: 2024-12-22)

**Skills — No conflicts found.**

Checked pairs:
- `skill-assistant` vs `skill-creator` — **Complementary**, not conflicting. One finds/installs skills, the other guides creation.
- `anthropic` (new) replaced `anthropic-best-practices.md` (loose file) — new skill is more comprehensive.

**Agents — 125 installed from [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents).**

Note: VoltAgent's `code-reviewer.md` replaced obra/superpowers version.

**MCP Servers — No conflicts found.**
- `notion` — Notion workspace integration (search, read, create, update pages/databases)
- `n8n-mcp` — n8n workflow automation (create, manage, execute workflows)

### Bundled Items

Some skills/agents contain sub-items in nested folders:

| Bundle | Contains |
|--------|----------|
| `skills/document-skills/` | `docx/`, `pdf/`, `pptx/`, `xlsx/` |

Each sub-folder has its own `SKILL.md` with type-specific instructions.

### Installation Rules

Applies to skills, agents, and MCP servers:

1. **Avoid duplicates** — Before installing, check if a similar one exists
2. **Clean install preferred** — When updating, delete the old directory first:
   ```bash
   rm -rf skills/my-skill && cp -R /source/my-skill skills/
   rm -rf agents/my-agent && cp -R /source/my-agent agents/
   ```
3. **Naming convention** — Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., `my-skill-name`, `my-agent-name`)
4. **Check for overlap** — If two items do similar things, keep only one or ensure they handle distinct use cases
5. **MCP server config** — Store in `.mcp.json` (project-level, gitignored for API keys) or `~/.claude.json` (user-level)

### Priority & Conflicts

When multiple skills/agents could handle a request:
- Skills: Both loaded into context (may cause unpredictable behavior if conflicting)
- Agents: User/Claude chooses which to invoke

**Resolution**: Remove duplicates or ensure clear separation of concerns

### Scaling Considerations

**Skills:**
| Concern | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Context bloat | Medium | More skills loaded = more tokens per request |
| Conflicts | Medium | Similar skills may give contradictory instructions |
| Noise | Low | Wrong skill may activate for your request |
| Maintenance | Low | More to update when things change |

*Skills only load when relevant — unused ones don't cost much.*

**Agents:**
| Concern | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Minimal overhead | Very Low | Only run when explicitly called |

*Install freely — agents are just available options until invoked.*

**MCP Servers:**
| Concern | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Startup time | Low-Medium | Each server initializes when Claude Code starts |
| Resource usage | Medium | Running processes/connections during session |
| API costs | Varies | Some services charge per call |
| Credential management | Medium | More API keys to secure/rotate |
| Rate limits | Varies | External APIs may throttle |

*Be selective with MCP servers — each one is an active dependency.*

### MCP Server Types

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **stdio** | Local process spawned when Claude Code starts, killed on exit | `n8n-mcp` |
| **http** | Remote server, connection made on demand, no local process | `notion` |

MCP servers are **not always running** — they start with Claude Code sessions and can be enabled/disabled per project.

## Session Management

### Resuming Conversations

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `claude --continue` | Resume most recent conversation in current directory |
| `claude --resume` | Interactive picker for all sessions |
| `claude --resume <name>` | Resume specific named session |

### Best Practice

Always name important sessions with `/rename <name>` for easy retrieval later.

## Skills vs Agents

| Aspect | Skills | Agents |
|--------|--------|--------|
| What they are | Markdown prompts/instructions | Subprocesses via Task tool |
| Location | `skills/` directory | Built-in or `agents/` directory |
| Invocation | `/skill-name` or auto-matched | Task tool with `subagent_type` |
| Context | Shares main conversation | Isolated subprocess |
| Use case | Reusable prompts, domain knowledge | Multi-step autonomous tasks |

---

## Installed MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose | Capabilities |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `notion` | Notion workspace | Search, fetch, create/update pages & databases, manage comments |
| `n8n-mcp` | Workflow automation | Create/manage n8n workflows, search nodes, deploy templates, execute workflows |

### MCP Server Selection

| Need | Server |
|------|--------|
| Note-taking, documentation, databases | `notion` |
| Workflow automation, integrations | `n8n-mcp` |
| Both systems connected | Use n8n workflow with Notion nodes |
