## Skills Management

### Overlap Analysis (Last checked: 2024-12-22)

| Skills | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `skill-assistant` vs `skill-creator` | Complementary | skill-assistant finds/installs skills; skill-creator guides creation. Both may activate on "create a skill" requests but instructions are compatible. |
| `document-skills/pdf` | Nested skill | Part of document-skills bundle (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx). No external PDF skill conflict. |

### Installation Rules

1. **Avoid duplicates** — Before installing a skill, check if a similar one exists
2. **Clean install preferred** — When updating a skill, delete the old directory first:
   ```bash
   rm -rf skills/my-skill && cp -R /source/my-skill skills/
   ```
3. **Naming convention** — Use kebab-case for skill directories (e.g., `my-skill-name`)

### Skill Priority

When multiple skills match a request:
- Both are loaded into context (no strict priority)
- Conflicting instructions may cause unpredictable behavior
- **Resolution**: Remove or rename one skill to avoid overlap

## Session Management

### Resuming Conversations

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `claude --continue` | Resume most recent conversation in current directory |
| `claude --resume` | Interactive picker for all sessions |
| `claude --resume <name>` | Resume specific named session |

### Best Practice

Always name important sessions with `/rename <name>` for easy retrieval later.

## Skills vs Agents

| Aspect | Skills | Agents |
|--------|--------|--------|
| What they are | Markdown prompts/instructions | Subprocesses via Task tool |
| Location | `skills/` directory | Built-in or `agents/` directory |
| Invocation | `/skill-name` or auto-matched | Task tool with `subagent_type` |
| Context | Shares main conversation | Isolated subprocess |
| Use case | Reusable prompts, domain knowledge | Multi-step autonomous tasks |
