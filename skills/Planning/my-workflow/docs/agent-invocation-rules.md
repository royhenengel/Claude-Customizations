# Agent Invocation Rules

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Source**: [agent-comparison-v2.md](../../../workspace/features/audit-agents/agent-comparison-v2.md)

Quick-reference guide for selecting the right agent. When in doubt, check the trigger first, then the stage, then the language.

## Selection Rationale

Agent selections are based on evidence from side-by-side agent comparison (see source). Selection criteria:

1. **Domain Depth**: Deep domain knowledge produces better results than shallow structural formatting
2. **Breadth**: Wider coverage handles more real-world scenarios
3. **Adaptability**: Agents that work in any project context are preferred over those requiring specific structures
4. **Prompt Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous instructions produce more consistent results
5. **Completeness**: No blind spots in coverage

Structural features (checklists, templates, binary pass/fail formats) can be retrofitted to any agent prompt. These are not primary selection criteria.

## Trigger-Based Selection

| Trigger | Agent | Justification |
| ------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Complex feature planning | cek-software-architect | Generates 5 design approaches with probabilities; creates implementation maps |
| Task execution (cross-stack) | fullstack-developer | Broadest coverage, highest adaptability across both layers |
| Task execution (backend) | backend-developer | Deep backend patterns: database architecture, APIs, microservices, Docker |
| Task execution (AC-driven) | cek-developer | When project uses AC, Story Context XML, and tasks.md workflow |
| Code review needed | code-reviewer | 8 review dimensions, language-specific patterns, works in any codebase |
| Quality gate (binary) | cek-code-quality-reviewer | 50+ binary pass/fail items with numeric score for trend tracking |

| **Review (Architecture)** | architect-reviewer | cek-software-architect | Use architect for design creation; reviewer for validation |
| **Review (Security)** | security-auditor | cek-security-auditor, penetration-tester | cek for PR-level code review; pen-tester for active testing |
| **Debugging (Bug Finding)** | cek-bug-hunter | debugger | cek for structured root cause analysis (Five Whys); debugger for general/poorly-defined issues |
| **Debugging (Active)** | debugger | error-detective | Use debugger for known issues; error-detective for production analysis |
| **Documentation** | cek-tech-writer | api-documenter, documentation-engineer | api-documenter for OpenAPI specs; documentation-engineer for doc system infrastructure |

## Language Routing

| Language/Framework | Preferred Agent | Alternative |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| TypeScript | typescript-pro | javascript-pro |
| JavaScript | javascript-pro | - |
| Python | python-pro | django-developer |
| Go | golang-pro | - |
| Rust | rust-engineer | - |
| C# | csharp-developer | dotnet-core-expert |
| Java | java-architect | spring-boot-engineer |
| PHP | php-pro | laravel-specialist |
| Ruby/Rails | rails-expert | - |
| Swift | swift-expert | - |
| Kotlin | kotlin-specialist | - |

## Decision Flow

1. **Check trigger first** - If the task matches a specific trigger above, use that agent
2. **Check language** - For implementation tasks, route to language-specific agent
3. **Check workflow stage** - Use stage defaults if no specific trigger or language matches
4. **Fall back to fullstack-developer** - Broadest coverage, works in any project context

## Infrastructure Tasks

| Task Type | Agent |
| --------- | ----- |
| Kubernetes | kubernetes-specialist |
| Azure cloud | azure-infra-engineer |
| CI/CD pipelines | build-engineer |
| Deployment | deployment-engineer |
| DevOps | devops-engineer |
| Site reliability | sre-engineer |
| Network | network-engineer |
| Windows Server | windows-infra-admin |

## Domain-Specific Routing

High-value domains with explicit triggers:

| Domain Indicator | Agent | When Triggered |
| ---------------- | ----- | -------------- |
| ML/AI codebase or task | ml-engineer | Model training, inference, ML pipelines |
| Data science work | data-scientist | Statistical analysis, modeling, visualization |
| Data pipelines/ETL | data-engineer | Building and maintaining data infrastructure |
| Dashboards/BI | data-analyst | Data analysis, insights, reporting |

| GraphQL schema/API | graphql-architect | GraphQL design and optimization |
| WebSocket/real-time | websocket-engineer | Real-time communication systems |

## Implicit Discovery

These agents are invoked when task context clearly indicates domain relevance. Selection criteria: the task description, codebase patterns, or user request must explicitly reference the domain.

| Category | Agents | Context Signal |
| -------- | ------ | -------------- |
| Finance | fintech-engineer, quant-analyst, payment-integration | Payment processing, trading algorithms, financial regulations |
| Games | game-developer | Game engine, rendering, multiplayer systems |
| IoT/Embedded | iot-engineer, embedded-systems | Microcontrollers, RTOS, device connectivity |

| Business | legal-advisor, customer-success-manager, product-manager, scrum-master | Non-technical business tasks |
| UX | ux-researcher, ui-designer | User research, interface design |

## Archived Agents

These agents are marked for archival and should not be used:

| Agent | Replacement | Reason |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| mobile-developer | mobile-app-developer | Redundant; merged into mobile-app-developer |
| machine-learning-engineer | ml-engineer | Redundant; both cover ML lifecycle, ml-engineer has better coverage |
| frontend-developer | fullstack-developer or react-specialist | Weakest developer agent; lowest depth, breadth, and adaptability |
