## Skills, Agents & MCP Servers

### When to Use Which

| Use Case | Best Tool | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Reusable prompts/templates | **Skill** | Simple, shares conversation context |
| Domain knowledge/standards | **Skill** | Instructions loaded when relevant |
| Quick behavior enhancements | **Skill** | No subprocess overhead |
| Multi-step autonomous tasks | **Agent** | Runs independently, returns results |
| Parallel execution | **Agent** | Multiple agents can run simultaneously |
| Complex exploration/research | **Agent** | Isolated context, thorough investigation |
| External API integration | **MCP Server** | Direct tool access to external services |
| Real-time data from services | **MCP Server** | Live connection to databases, APIs, apps |
| Actions in external systems | **MCP Server** | Create, update, delete in connected services |

### Tool Selection Guide

```
Need to extend Claude's knowledge/behavior?
├── Static instructions or templates? → Skill
├── Autonomous multi-step work? → Agent
└── Connect to external service/API? → MCP Server

Need to interact with external system?
├── Read/write data? → MCP Server
├── One-time API call? → Skill (with fetch) or MCP Server
└── Complex workflow automation? → MCP Server + Agent
```

### Overlap Analysis (Last checked: 2024-12-22)

**Skills — No conflicts found.**

Checked pairs:
- `skill-assistant` vs `skill-creator` — **Complementary**, not conflicting. One finds/installs skills, the other guides creation.
- `anthropic` (new) replaced `anthropic-best-practices.md` (loose file) — new skill is more comprehensive.

**Agents — 142 installed.**

Sources:
- [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents) (125 agents)
- [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (1 agent)
- [glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources](https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources) (3 agents)
- [NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit](https://github.com/NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit) (13 agents)

Note: Both repos provided code-reviewer agents. Kept both with distinct purposes:
- `code-reviewer.md` — General comprehensive reviews (VoltAgent)
- `code-reviewer-plan.md` — Plan-alignment reviews (obra, works with writing-plans/executing-plans skills)

**MCP Servers — No conflicts found.**
- `notion` — Notion workspace integration (search, read, create, update pages/databases)
- `n8n-mcp` — n8n workflow automation (create, manage, execute workflows)

### Bundled Items

Some skills/agents contain sub-items in nested folders:

| Bundle | Contains |
|--------|----------|
| `skills/document-skills/` | `docx/`, `pdf/`, `pptx/`, `xlsx/` |

Each sub-folder has its own `SKILL.md` with type-specific instructions.

### Installation Rules

Applies to skills, agents, and MCP servers:

1. **Avoid duplicates** — Before installing, check if a similar one exists
2. **Clean install preferred** — When updating, delete the old directory first:
   ```bash
   rm -rf skills/my-skill && cp -R /source/my-skill skills/
   rm -rf agents/my-agent && cp -R /source/my-agent agents/
   ```
3. **Naming convention** — Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., `my-skill-name`, `my-agent-name`)
4. **Check for overlap** — If two items do similar things, keep only one or ensure they handle distinct use cases
5. **MCP server config** — Store in `.mcp.json` (project-level, gitignored for API keys) or `~/.claude.json` (user-level)

### Priority & Conflicts

When multiple skills/agents could handle a request:
- Skills: Both loaded into context (may cause unpredictable behavior if conflicting)
- Agents: User/Claude chooses which to invoke

**Resolution**: Remove duplicates or ensure clear separation of concerns

### Scaling Considerations

**Skills:**
| Concern | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Context bloat | Medium | More skills loaded = more tokens per request |
| Conflicts | Medium | Similar skills may give contradictory instructions |
| Noise | Low | Wrong skill may activate for your request |
| Maintenance | Low | More to update when things change |

*Skills only load when relevant — unused ones don't cost much.*

**Agents:**
| Concern | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Minimal overhead | Very Low | Only run when explicitly called |

*Install freely — agents are just available options until invoked.*

**MCP Servers:**
| Concern | Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Startup time | Low-Medium | Each server initializes when Claude Code starts |
| Resource usage | Medium | Running processes/connections during session |
| API costs | Varies | Some services charge per call |
| Credential management | Medium | More API keys to secure/rotate |
| Rate limits | Varies | External APIs may throttle |

*Be selective with MCP servers — each one is an active dependency.*

### MCP Server Types

| Type | How it works | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **stdio** | Local process spawned when Claude Code starts, killed on exit | `n8n-mcp` |
| **http** | Remote server, connection made on demand, no local process | `notion` |

MCP servers are **not always running** — they start with Claude Code sessions and can be enabled/disabled per project.

## Session Management

### Resuming Conversations

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `claude --continue` | Resume most recent conversation in current directory |
| `claude --resume` | Interactive picker for all sessions |
| `claude --resume <name>` | Resume specific named session |

### Best Practice

Always name important sessions with `/rename <name>` for easy retrieval later.

---

## Context Preservation Strategies

Long conversations degrade as context compacts. Use these strategies to stay on course:

### 1. Write Plans to Files (Recommended)

Before executing, dump your plan to a file:
```
PLAN.md or .claude/scratchpad.md
```
Files survive context compaction. Re-read anytime to stay aligned.

### 2. Use Subagents for Execution

After gathering context, delegate execution to fresh agents:
```
"Use the Task tool to implement X based on the plan in PLAN.md"
```
Subagents start with clean 200K context and can read your plan file.

### 3. Break Into Separate Conversations

When you finish research/planning:
1. Have Claude write findings to a file (e.g., `CONTEXT.md`)
2. Start a new conversation
3. Begin with "Read CONTEXT.md and continue implementing..."

### 4. Use TodoWrite Aggressively

The todo list persists better than conversation context. Add detailed notes in task descriptions, not just titles.

### 5. Use Plan Mode for Complex Tasks

Say "enter plan mode" — this creates a dedicated plan file that becomes the source of truth. Benefits:
- Forces exploration before proposing changes
- Requires your approval before execution
- Separates thinking from doing
- Catches ambiguity early
- Creates a checkpoint if execution goes wrong

### 6. Periodic Anchoring

Every 10-15 messages on long tasks:
```
"Summarize our current state and next steps to a file"
```

### Quick Reference

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| PLAN.md file | Multi-step tasks, before execution phase |
| Subagents | Discrete tasks that can run independently |
| New conversation | Topic shift, context feels degraded |
| TodoWrite | Track progress, maintain focus |
| Plan mode | Architectural decisions, multi-file changes |
| Periodic anchoring | Long sessions (10+ messages) |

**Golden Rule**: Files are permanent; conversation context is not.

---

## Behavioral Rules

### Context-First Data Retrieval

**Trigger:** Any request to "load", "read", "check", or "follow" rules/content from external sources (Notion, APIs, files).

**Before making external API calls, ALWAYS:**

1. **Check existing context first**
   - Read MCP memory for previously stored content
   - Review conversation summary for already-extracted information
   - Check if the data was loaded in a previous session

2. **If content exists in memory/context:**
   - Confirm rules are present
   - State "ready" or summarize what's loaded
   - Do NOT re-fetch from source

3. **If content does NOT exist:**
   - Fetch only what's needed
   - For large documents (Notion pages with nested blocks): extract key rules, not full content
   - Stop when you have actionable information

**Never:**
- Re-fetch data that's already in memory or conversation context
- Chase nested content (toggles, children) when top-level summaries suffice
- Interpret "load rules" as "fetch complete document structure"
- Make multiple sequential API calls when a summary already exists

**Why this matters:**
- Notion pages can exceed 80K+ characters
- Nested block fetching multiplies API calls (6-10+ per document)
- Token limits cause failures and file dumps
- User time is wasted on redundant operations

**"Load" means:** Verify rules are accessible and follow them. Not: re-download everything.
